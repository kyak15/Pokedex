# About
The following project is a pokdex I built using React and basic CSS. It uses the pokedex API to fetch 20 pokemon per page. The React app uses pagination to get 20 new pokemon per page.
In addition, the project also utilizes react-router in order to allow the user to view pokemon in more details. 

# Getting Started 

To Launch Locally, install node package.

# Some Notes:

- pokemon specific page needs more details but will just require extra information from fetch requests.
- I want to change the useEffects in the components to use loaders() instead from react-router
- CSS needs a revamp from the simple styles on the page
