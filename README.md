# Getting Started 

To Launch Locally, install node package.

# Some Notes:

-CSS still needs a lot of work but that'll come with time.
-The main home button (the pokeball) only works on different routes, so that needs a fix
-I would like to include the use of search/query parameters later so when a user clicks a specific pokemon, their place in the pokedex is not lost
